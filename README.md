## Merge Sort vs. Bubble Sort
This program implements merge sort and bubble sort. The user inputs the length of a random array to be sorted, and then chooses whether to sort it using merge sort or using bubble sort. The program will then calculate the time it takes to sort the array using the method that was chosen, and display it. The array will also be shown before and after sorting if it is below 30 elements.

The user must enter an integer number for the length of the array.
The user then enters a 1 for merge sort or a 2 for bubble sort.

*Note that bubble sort only works for arrays under approximately 40000 elements

### Comparison
It is seen that merge sort is a faster sorting option than bubble sort, and it can handle larger array lengths in a shorter amount of time.
